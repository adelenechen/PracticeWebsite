# The Love for Old Art and the Hate for the New
Art is commonly expressed in music, literature, and drawing, and is commonly noted to evoke emotions on the viewer, hence "art is in the eye of the beholder." It's a common belief that art drawn in the past, around the 1900s and earlier, were all drawn with some deeper meaning --- the more famous ones, at least. Compared to modern art, where artists pursue stylized works and art in modern art museums, art seems to have lost its poetics in place for aesthetics. ("Modern Art" here refers to art that is commonly displayed in modern art museums, not art drawn on digital apps and whatnot).

### The Infamous Banana: _Comedian_
Created by Maurizio Cattelan, _Comedian_ is a banana duct taped to a wall that sold for $120,000 and was eaten shortly after. Modern art of this form is notorius for being tools for money laundering. These art pieces, to an art critic (which I am not), are easy to find due to its lack of emotions that one would normally see from art. As such, it's popular consensus that _Comedian_ is what you see: a banana taped to a wall. Even so, some people claim that the art piece _does_ in fact, have meaning. The banana expresses the strangeness of how people place importance on material objects, or it may describe and ridicule how modern media treats modern art in reverence.

### The Beloved _Girl With A Pearl Earring_
Painted by Johannes Vermeer, _Girl With A Pearl Earring_ is masterfully painted, beloved for the girl's enigmatic expression and the large pearl hanging for her ear. Much of the intrigue for this painting is that of which captured audiences with the _Mona Lisa_: an unknown woman with a puzzling expresion. Unlike _The Comedian_, it takes all but a glance to tell that the painting is painted with great care. This is one of the main reasons on why people love old art and hate modern art: most modern art looks like something that the viewer could do with little to no expierence, while old art is clearly very difficult to do well.

From what I've seen, the hate for modern art is connected to how hard one worked to achieve results. This can be evidenced from the infamous faceless traced photos on social media, where people trace photos and color it in, leaving the faces blank. Anyone can trace and color, leading to the idea of "I could have done that," --- a phrase that pursues modern art.
