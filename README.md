# The Love for Old Art and the Hate for the New
Art is commonly expressed in music, literature, and drawing, and is commonly noted to evoke emotions on the viewer, hence "art is in the eye of the beholder." It's a common belief that art drawn in the past, around the 1900s and earlier, were all drawn with some deeper meaning --- the more famous ones, at least. Compared to modern art, where artists pursue stylized works and art in modern art museums, art seems to have lost its poetics in place for aesthetics.

### The Infamous Banana: _The Comedian_
Created by Maurizio Cattelan, _the Comedian_ is a banana duct taped to a wall that sold for $120,000 and was eaten shortly after. Modern art of this form is notorius for being tools for money laundering. These art pieces, to an art critic (which I am not), are easy to find due to its lack of emotions that one would normally see from art. As such, it's popular consensus that _The Comedian_ is what you see: a banana duct taped to a wall.
